Ice Beast scale problem
Harder ranged minions
Reinitialize the section when going back to a checkpoint
Rage scaling sometimes wrong
Showcase each enemy at a time
Avoid chaotic combat - more control
"Triggers" for the level
Shadows
Snowball coming from beast's hands
Ranged orb going off the level problem
Transparency problems
More tells for the AI
Fire guy way too fast
Asset Pipeline + Art Request

Lebo's input:

shadows
where the snowballs come out of ice beast
check design for ranged about other types of separations (moats or cliffs etc.)
ai tells
speed of ranged increased
check ranged destruction cases
speed of fire beast too fast
look at function potentially wrong causing skewing and enemies not looking at what they are supposed to
