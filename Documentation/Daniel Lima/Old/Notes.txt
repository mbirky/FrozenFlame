Berserker PPT Notes
- Yeti and Magma Beast have the same behavior... Maybe we could change one of them a little bit later.
- We don't talk about the Rage system at all on the power point.
- "Consisting of"s in the Where slides.
- No text on HUD slide.

Boost PPT Notes
- Melee is not one of the actions, however we comment on it a bunch of times. I think the teacher might ask about that.
- What does "Grunt" means in the enemies slides? A sound?
- Melee control present on keyboard slide but not on controller slide.
- I didn't know what game to use for the art style so I just used Monday Night Combat.
- Recap says it occurs within a virtual world but it doesn't seem to much like that on the "Where" slides.

General
- Game Flow for both games is the same. Is that right?
