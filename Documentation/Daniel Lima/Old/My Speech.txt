Our main character used to live a calm life with his lover in the ice realm, until an evil wizard, king of the fire realm, decided to kidnap her in his castle.
Now this warrior will have to go on a journey with only his trusty sword to kill the wizard and rescue his lady.

After passing through various thresholds and gaining more power, the warrior breaks into the wizard's castle and has a one-on-one fight against him.

The wizard's basic attack is throwing a not-so-strong magic orb at you. He'll raise his staff over his head and then swing it downward right before shooting the orb. To deal with this, you'll have to attack in the right moment to deflect the orb back at the wizard and stun him for a while, so that you can deal more damage.

After some time, the wizard will start raising both his arms above his head, which will create a red shadow below the player. You'll need to dash quickly to avoid suffering a lot of damage from erupting lava that will come from the ground.

When he's close to being killed, the wizard will abandon his pride and ask for help. As he slams his staff to the ground, a gate will open and hordes of game enemies will spawn. The player will have to kill or avoid them as he did throughout the game, while fighting the wizard.
